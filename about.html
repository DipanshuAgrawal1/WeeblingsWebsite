    <h2>History</h2><br>
    <p>"Back in Japan, after World War II, a young aspiring artist named
       Osamu Tezuka became a cartoonist and released his first work Shintakarajima
       (known in English as "New Treasure Island"). As a child, Tezuka was a
       fanatical fan of Walt Disney's early animations. Many were impressed
       by Tezuka's original style. However, it was not until Tezuka released
       his ultimate work Tetsuwan Atomu (Astro Boy) that he achieved success;
       he was pronounced "the Father of Manga and Anime".(Zagzoug)."
       Osamu Tezuka led the way for many other anime titles to become big and successful.</p>
